## About Me 

I’m a 19 years old computer scientist interested in the domains of game programming, </br>
animation/imagery, security, networking, application development and much more. I am </br>
a fan of video games and of the japanese culture more precisely, their style of</br> 
architecture and customs.

 </br>

## Projects: 

Still being in college, I currently do not have any personal project to show for. What I do</br> 
have is school projects that I’ve worked on in the past years. The following are some of those projects. 

</br>

# Disclaimer 

The following projects are not my whole doing. I am implicated in the implementation of multiple</br> 
features for those projects, but they are the creation of my instructor Vikram Singh(1). Even though</br> 
these projects are not entirely my doing, I possess the key concepts and needed knowledge to replicate</br> 
them and make other games.

## Pong

For this game project, we were tasked with creating an AI for the right paddle so that the player can play</br>
alone. This is possible by following the ball coordinates and moving the paddle’s coordinates at its turn.

## Breakout

For this game project, we were tasked with implementing a powerup (a pickable object which affect the game)</br> 
which makes two more balls for the player to play with. The challenge with this implementation was to create</br> 
the ball and keep track of them. This was challenging because of the multiple states (windows displayed: game</br> 
over, game won, game in play and more) that were recreating the game each time. In addition, we had to make</br> 
the paddle grow bigger when the player got a high enough score without losing a life, with the score getting</br> 
increasingly more demanding. This was achieved by tracking the score and position of the paddle and then</br> 
switching them with prior extracted sprites of the bigger paddle.

## Match 3

For this game project, we were tasked with adding new types of tiles to the play board, the star tile which</br> 
clears the row or column depending on the direction of the match and the tiles with patterns which yield more</br> 
points. The difficulty of this one was the way to access the tiles affected by a star matches, this was made</br> 
posible by corolating the board size with the collection of tiles and then deducing the affected tiles.

## Zelda

For this game project, we were tasked with introducing two new feature to the dungeon. Adding pots which can be</br> 
picked up and thrown at enemies and adding hearts which have a chance to appear when you defeat an enemy and that</br> 
you can pick up to gain a full heart back. Hearts were not so troublesome, to implement them I had to get each time</br>
an enemy is defeated and run a randomizer for the chance of the heart appearing. As for the pots, they were a bit</br>
more complicated but nothing impossible. To implement the pots I had to first generate them for each room and then</br> 
create new states (here they are more like action off the main character) for the player picking up, carrying and</br> 
throwing the pot. Here the challenging part was how to make everything work together as each of the mentioned objects</br>
are separate, to fix that creating another object that manage all of the others was the key to put everything together.
