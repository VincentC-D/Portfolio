## About Me 

I’m a computer scientist interested in the domains of game programming, </br>
animation/imagery, security, networking, application development and much more.  

 </br>

## Projects: 

Still being in college, I currently do not have any personal project to show for. What I do</br> 
have is school projects that I’ve worked on in the past years. The following are some of those projects. 

</br>

# Disclaimer 

The following projects are not my whole doing. I am implicated in the implementation of multiple</br> 
features for those projects, but they are the creation of my instructor Vikram Singh(1). Even though</br> 
these projects are not entirely my doing, I possess the key concepts and needed knowledge to replicate</br> 
them and make other games.

## Pong

For this game project, we were tasked with creating an AI for the right paddle so that the player can play</br>
alone. This is possible by following the ball coordinates and moving the paddle’s coordinates at its turn.

## Breakout

For this game project, we were tasked with implementing a powerup (a pickable object which affect the game)</br> 
which makes two more balls for the player to play with. The challenge with this implementation was to create</br> 
the ball and keep track of them. This was challenging because of the multiple states (windows displayed: game</br> 
over, game won, game in play and more) that were recreating the game each time. In addition, we had to make</br> 
the paddle grow bigger when the player got a high enough score without losing a life, with the score getting</br> 
increasingly more demanding. This was achieved by tracking the score and position of the paddle and then</br> 
switching them with prior extracted sprites of the bigger paddle.

## Match 3
For this game project, we were tasked with adding new types of tiles to the play board, the star tile which</br> 
clears the row or column depending on the direction of the match and the tiles with patterns which yield more</br> 
points. The difficulty of this one was the way to access the tiles affected by a star matches, this was made</br> 
posible by corolating the board size with the collection of tiles and then deducing the affected tiles.
